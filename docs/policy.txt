Course Policies and Academic Rules
==================================

1. Assignment Deadlines and Late Submission Policy
--------------------------------------------------
All assignments must be submitted by the posted due date and time as specified on the course syllabus and the online learning platform.

Assignments submitted after the due date will be considered late. Late submissions are subject to grade penalties according to the following rules:

- Assignments submitted within 24 hours after the due date will receive a 10% reduction of the total possible score.
- Assignments submitted between 24 and 48 hours after the due date will receive a 20% reduction.
- Assignments submitted between 48 and 72 hours after the due date will receive a 30% reduction.
- Assignments submitted more than 72 hours after the due date will not be accepted and will receive a score of zero.

Late penalties are applied per calendar day, not per class meeting.

2. Exceptions for Illness or Emergency
--------------------------------------
Students who are unable to submit assignments on time due to documented illness, medical emergencies, or serious personal circumstances may request an extension.

To be considered for an extension, students must meet the following requirements:

- Notify the instructor as soon as possible, preferably before the assignment due date.
- Provide appropriate documentation, such as a doctor's note or official hospital record.
- Submit the request for extension within three (3) calendar days of the original due date.

Approval of extensions is at the discretion of the instructor. If approved, the late penalty may be partially or fully waived depending on the circumstances.

3. Attendance and Participation
--------------------------------
Regular attendance is expected for all scheduled classes, labs, and discussion sections.

Students are allowed up to two (2) unexcused absences without penalty. Additional unexcused absences may result in a reduction of the participation grade.

Excused absences include, but are not limited to:
- Illness with medical documentation
- Religious observances
- University-sponsored activities

4. Academic Integrity
---------------------
All students are expected to adhere to the highest standards of academic integrity.

Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to:
- Cheating on exams or quizzes
- Plagiarism in assignments or projects
- Unauthorized collaboration

Any violation of academic integrity policies will be reported to the academic affairs office and may result in disciplinary action, including course failure or suspension.

5. Grading Disputes
-------------------
Students who wish to dispute a grade must submit a written request explaining the reason for the dispute within five (5) business days of receiving the grade.

Grade disputes submitted after this period will not be considered.

6. Use of Artificial Intelligence Tools
---------------------------------------
The use of artificial intelligence tools, including language models and automated code generation tools, is permitted for learning and drafting purposes unless explicitly prohibited by the instructor.

Students must disclose any use of AI tools in their submitted work and are responsible for ensuring the accuracy and originality of their submissions.

Unauthorized or undisclosed use of AI tools may be treated as a violation of academic integrity.
