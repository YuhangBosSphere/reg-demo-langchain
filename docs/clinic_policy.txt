This document describes clinic operational policies (scheduling, communication, refills, lab results, billing, privacy). It does not provide medical advice. In a medical emergency, call local emergency services immediately.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. APPOINTMENTS, CHECK-IN, AND LATE ARRIVAL
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1 Appointment Types
- New patient visit (40 minutes)
- Follow-up visit (20 minutes)
- Annual physical (40 minutes)
- Telehealth visit (20 minutes), if clinically appropriate
- Nurse visit (10–20 minutes) for vaccinations, blood pressure checks, or routine labs as ordered

1.2 Check-In
Patients are asked to arrive 10–15 minutes early for registration and paperwork. Insurance and photo ID may be required.

1.3 Late Arrival Policy
- If a patient arrives 10 minutes late, the visit may be shortened to address only one primary concern.
- If a patient arrives 15 minutes or more late, the appointment may be rescheduled.
- Exceptions may be granted for documented emergencies at the discretion of the clinic.

1.4 No-Show and Late Cancellation Policy
- Cancellations made less than 24 hours before the appointment time may incur a late cancellation fee.
- Missing an appointment without notice is considered a no-show.
- After 3 no-shows or late cancellations within 12 months, the clinic may require same-day scheduling only, or may discontinue non-urgent scheduling access.
- Fee amounts vary by service type and are disclosed in the billing section.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. COMMUNICATION CHANNELS AND RESPONSE TIMES
--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Patient Portal (Preferred)
The patient portal is the preferred channel for non-urgent questions, prescription refills, forms, and results follow-up.
- Typical response time: within 2 business days.
- Messages received after 4 PM may be processed the next business day.

2.2 Phone Calls
Phone calls are intended for time-sensitive but non-emergency matters.
- Typical response time: same business day or within 1 business day.

2.3 After-Hours Policy
After-hours calls are routed to an on-call service for urgent matters. Non-urgent questions should be directed to the portal and will be addressed during business hours.

2.4 Emergency Symptoms
The clinic does not manage medical emergencies via portal messages.
If a patient reports emergency symptoms (e.g., severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, signs of stroke, uncontrolled bleeding), staff will direct the patient to emergency services immediately.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. TRIAGE: URGENT VS NON-URGENT REQUESTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Definitions
- Non-urgent: stable symptoms, routine questions, medication refills without immediate risk
- Urgent: worsening symptoms, significant pain, new concerning symptoms requiring same-day guidance
- Emergent: potentially life-threatening symptoms requiring emergency services

3.2 Triage Workflow
- All clinical messages are initially reviewed by trained clinical staff.
- If clinical decision-making is required, the message is routed to a licensed clinician.
- Triage decisions are documented in the patient record.

3.3 Same-Day Appointments
Same-day appointments are limited and typically reserved for urgent issues. Availability is not guaranteed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4. PRESCRIPTIONS AND REFILLS
--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 Routine Refills
Patients should request refills at least 5 business days before the medication is needed.
Refill requests should include:
- Medication name and dose
- Preferred pharmacy
- Whether the medication is new or previously prescribed by this clinic

4.2 Controlled Substances
Controlled substances (including certain pain medications and stimulants) are subject to additional requirements:
- Refills generally require an appointment (in-person or telehealth) as determined by the clinician.
- Early refills are generally not provided.
- Lost or stolen medication may not be replaced; documentation (e.g., police report) may be requested.
- The clinic may require periodic urine drug screening and review of prescription monitoring data.

Some medications require prior authorization from insurance.
- Typical processing time: 5–10 business days, depending on insurer response.
- The clinic cannot guarantee approval decisions made by insurers.

Medication changes or new prescriptions generally require clinical evaluation. Requests for new antibiotics, new controlled medications, or dose escalations may require an appointment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5. LAB RESULTS, IMAGING, AND TEST FOLLOW-UP
--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.1 Routine Results
Routine lab results are typically released through the portal within 3–5 business days after the lab processes the sample.
Imaging results may take 5–7 business days.

5.2 Abnormal Results
If results are significantly abnormal, the clinic will attempt to contact the patient by phone and/or portal message.
Patients are responsible for maintaining updated contact information.

5.3 “No News” Is Not Always “Good News”
Patients should follow up if they have not received results within expected timeframes.

5.4 External Lab/Imaging
If testing is completed outside the clinic’s network, the patient may need to request that results be forwarded to the clinic. External results may take additional time to be reviewed and documented.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
7. TELEHEALTH POLICY
--------------------------------------------------------------------
7.1 Eligibility
Telehealth is appropriate for some follow-ups, medication management, and certain acute issues, but not all conditions can be assessed remotely.
